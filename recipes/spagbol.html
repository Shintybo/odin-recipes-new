    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
    <p><strong>Spaghetti Bolognase</strong>..........<u>WOW</u>......This is my happy place. A bowl of steaming hot pasta tangled with a beautifully rich and smooth bolognese sauce exploding with so much flavour youâ€™ll be dipping and licking the sauce directly from the wooden spoon before it hits the pasta!</p>
    
    <p>With a hint of red wine, oregano and parsley, plus added cream to to give the sauce a smooth and creamy texture. The smells coming out of this bubbling garlic infused tomato richness draws everyone out of their rooms to find out exactly what is going down for dinner.</p>
