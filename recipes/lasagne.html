    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Lasange</strong> is an all time favorite amongst many, this dish originated in Italy during the middle ages and has traditonally been
        ascribed to the city of Naples, stacked layers of thin, flat pasta with fillings such as ragu, ground meats and tomatoe sauce 
        and other vegtables, cheese, seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled
        with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagne is cut into single serving sqare portions.</p>

    <h2>Step by step guide</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan 
            and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins 
            until browned all over.</li>
            <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, 
                then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. 
                    Add a little grated nutmeg, then season</li>
                    <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich</li>
                    <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
                    <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. 
                        Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
                    <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
                    <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
                    <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly brown</li>
                </ol>
    <h3>Recipe Tips</h3>
    <p><u>PREPARE AHEAD AND FREEZE</u></p>
    <p>Assemble your lasagne then freeze (don't cook it first). If baking from frozen, add another 45 minutes to the cooking time. 
        You can also freeze the meat sauce by itself for up to 3 months. </p>
